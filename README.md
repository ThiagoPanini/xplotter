Python library created for making the Exploratory Data Analysis process so much easier! With `xplotter`, data scientists or data analysists can use a vast number of functions for plotting, customizing and extracting insights from data with very few lines of codes. The exploratory step is, at least, a key step on every data project and it's very important to understand your data before take any action. The use cases are almost infinity!
